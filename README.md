- Ensure fast navigation and search.  
- Maintain consistent branding through typography and colors.  
- Provide a smooth, frictionless booking flow.

### 📋 Key Pages

| Page                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays multiple properties with filters, search, and pagination          |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows property images, amenities, reviews, and booking options             |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Allows users to confirm booking details and finalize reservations          |

A user-friendly design increases trust, reduces drop-offs, and improves conversion rates.
