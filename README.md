## ✨ UI/UX Design Planning

### 🎯 Design Goals

- Clean, intuitive interface (responsive)  
- Fast, easy navigation & search  
- Simple, frictionless booking flow  
- Consistent branding via design tokens  

### 📋 Key Pages

| Page                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays multiple properties with filters, search, pagination              |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows images, descriptions, amenities, reviews, booking options            |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Minimal, clear form to confirm booking and finalize reservation            |

A user-friendly booking system increases trust, reduces drop-offs, and encourages users to complete the checkout.

### **Color Styles**

- Primary: `#FF5A5F`  
- Secondary / Accent: `#00A699`, `#767676`  
- Background / Neutrals: `#FFFFFF`, `#F5F5F5`

### **Typography**

- **Font Family:** Inter / Poppins  
- **Weights:** 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 700 (Bold)  
- **Sizes:**  
  - Headings: 24–32px  
  - Subheadings: 18–20px  
  - Body text: 14–16px  

Defining these design tokens ensures consistency across components and avoids ambiguity when building UI from mockups.

## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

Here are some of the reusable components planned:

- **Navbar / Header** — navigation across pages  
- **Property Card** — for listing displays (image, title, price)  
- **Footer** — site-wide footer with links  
- **Filters / Search Bar** — for narrowing down listings  
- **Image Slider / Gallery** — in listing detail page  
- **Booking Form / Input Components / Modals**

These patterns help keep the UI consistent, easier to maintain, and speed up development by reusing building blocks.
